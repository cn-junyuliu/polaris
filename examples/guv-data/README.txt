Mai Tran prepared the sample of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Mai Tran and
Min Guo imaged the sample on 2018-07-26 using the Shroff lab's asymmetric NA
(1.1 and 0.71) diSPIM outfitted with polarizers. Min Guo de-sheared,
isotropized, and registered the raw data sets and delivered the preprocessed
data with calibration data to Talon Chandler. Talon Chandler summarized the
calibration data in a single file suitable for reconstruction.

The raw data and preprocessed data can be found on Naushon at:
